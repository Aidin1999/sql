# SQL Training README

Welcome to my SQL training repository! Over time, I have worked through various SQL files to become proficient in different aspects of SQL. This README provides a brief overview of each file and its purpose in my training.

## Files Overview

### 1. `creating-db.sql`
This file focuses on creating databases and defining relationships between tables. It includes:
- **Creating Tables**: Defining the structure of tables with columns, data types, and constraints.
- **Defining Relationships**: Setting up primary keys and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.

### 2. `select-from.sql`
In this file, I practiced essential SQL skills and operations including:
- **Basic Queries**: Using the `SELECT` statement to retrieve data.
- **Filtering Data**: Applying `WHERE` clauses to filter results.
- **Sorting Data**: Using `ORDER BY` to sort query results.

### 3. `join.sql`
This file contains exercises on various types of joins, including:
- **Inner Joins**: Retrieving matching rows from multiple tables.
- **Left and Right Joins**: Including rows from one table regardless of matches in another.
- **Full Outer Joins**: Combining rows from both tables, matching where possible.

### 4. `subqueries.sql`
In this file, I focused on subqueries, which are queries nested inside other queries. Topics include:
- **Scalar Subqueries**: Returning a single value.
- **Correlated Subqueries**: Using values from the outer query.
- **Exists and Not Exists**: Checking for the existence of rows.

### 5. `set-operations.sql`
This file explores set operations used to combine results from multiple queries. Operations include:
- **UNION**: Combining results and removing duplicates.
- **UNION ALL**: Combining results including duplicates.
- **INTERSECT**: Finding common rows between queries.
- **EXCEPT**: Retrieving rows from the first query that do not appear in the second query.

### 6. `table-expressions.sql`
This file covers table expressions, including:
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Defining temporary result sets.
- **Derived Tables**: Using subqueries in the `FROM` clause.
- **Table Variables**: Declaring and using temporary tables.

### 7. `data-manipulation.sql`
This file deals with data manipulation operations such as:
- **INSERT**: Adding new rows to tables.
- **UPDATE**: Modifying existing rows.
- **DELETE**: Removing rows from tables.

### 8. `table-expressions-advanced.sql`
This file builds on basic table expressions, exploring more advanced uses:
- **Recursive CTEs**: Implementing recursion in queries.
- **Hierarchical Data**: Managing and querying hierarchical relationships.

### 9. `advanced.sql`
Here, I explored more advanced SQL concepts including:
- **Window Functions**: Performing calculations across sets of rows related to the current row.
- **Ranking Functions**: Assigning ranks to rows within a partition.

### 10. `transactions.sql`
This file focuses on transaction management, which includes:
- **Transaction Control**: Using `BEGIN TRAN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` to manage transactions.
- **Isolation Levels**: Understanding and setting different isolation levels to control concurrency.

### 11. `tsql.sql`
In this file, I practiced T-SQL (Transact-SQL) specific features and extensions, including:
- **Stored Procedures**: Creating and executing procedures to encapsulate complex queries.
- **Triggers**: Automatically executing code in response to changes in data.
- **Functions**: Creating and using user-defined functions.

## Conclusion

These files represent a comprehensive set of exercises and practice materials for mastering SQL. They cover fundamental operations, advanced querying techniques, and transaction management, preparing me for a wide range of SQL-related tasks and challenges.

Feel free to explore these files to understand different SQL concepts and improve your own SQL skills!
